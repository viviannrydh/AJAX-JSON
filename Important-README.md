# AJAX-JSON

A simple AJAX-JSON project by working with Open Library API.

In this project, there supposed to be four fetches. But two of them 'Find book's cover by cover-id' and 'Search for books by subjects' are not so stable. 

For example, "search for books by subjects" works perfectly for me before 30th of November, but after 30th of November, it only works 30% of times 
when I run exactly the same code as before. And "find books's cover by cover-id" still does not work' by 30th of November, although On Open Library API Github, they had 
annouced that they would fix that problem during last weekend.

Anyway, the "Search for books by author name " and "search for book's details by book name" works. Thank you.
